## Description
It is important to have a high-quality README.md This application generates a readme from the command line using the npm inquirer package. This application will include Title, Table of Contents, Description, Installation Instructions, Usage, Contributions, Tests, License including badges and link, Email, Github sername, Author name and Questions sections. 

## Installation Instructions  
Go to the github repo provided below and download the code. Make sure to npm install before running node. When you ruun node index, you will be prompted on the readme sections. when the prompt is done, a README.md will be generated in the dist folder.

## Process
I used the starter code, downloaded the packages and updated my dotgitignore. Next, I got to work on the index.js where I included the packages for the application. Next I created an array for the user input questions. Then I wrote a function to write a README.md file. Then created a function to intialize the app and finally a function to call the initialization. For the README.md elements, that was created in the generateMarkdown.js. There, I created functions to render the license and format the markdown.
